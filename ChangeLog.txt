FbEditMOD 1.0.7.8a BY CHERRY [cherry@cherrytree.at]

    - added support for %FBE_PATH% and %FBC_PATH% in EnvironPath values - but there is no way to use them in the UI, you have to edit the INI file manually
    - fixed crashes caused by overwriting constant strings (font names) - but I fear there might be more bugs like this still in there...
    - fixed crash when opening RC file
    - fixed crash related to reading of commandline
    - fixed various small bugs and crashes
    - changed icon
    - use tre4.dll for regex

FbEditMOD 1.0.7.8

    - all language files except NONE and german are currently broken
      (ENG is broken, please use NONE)
      addins should be recompiled before usage (include files has changed)
      activated addins are ready to go

    - [Edit]->[Elevator] moves caret lines up / down until same indent is found
        maybe useful for navigating through large control structures

    - [Edit]->[History Paste] shows the clipboard history
        double clicking a pane will paste its content
        contents are editable before pasting
        use ESC to hide the window

    - [Edit]->[Backward]
    - [Edit]->[Forward]
        caret movements to another line are logged
        moving around in this queue is done by ALT+LEFT / ALT+RIGHT
        scrolling line by line using UP / DOWN is not logged
        (not tested very well, i think there are some todos)

    - [Tools]->[Code Sniplets]
        copying to clipboard instead into editor is now available

    - [Tools]->[Export properties]
        actual scope is shown in the dialogbox
        scope can changed using toolbar buttons in top of the property window

    - [Options]->[Code Editor]
        editors linespacing can be changed by adding "Extra 1/4 LFs" to optimize
        readability
        0 to 8 quarter LFs are selectable (will also work for HexEdit)
        color selection will also work for HexEdit

     - very important: fancy splash screen fade out

     - [Project]->[Project Options]->[Pre-Buildbatch | Post-Buildbatch]
        Now we can execute a batch file before and after each compiler run
        See example Projects\Samples\Pre_PostBuildBatch\Pre_PostBuildBatch.fbp
        for details
        If modules are compiled separatly, there are several environment variables
        updated before launching each batch
        (so the batch aware, which run is coming up)

     - [Project]->[Project Options]->[Module Handling]
        if modules are compiled separatly, each module can have fbc commandline
        options for its own
        (perhaps you wanna use -gen gcc -O 2 not generally)
        Also you can translate several modules with other compilers (gcc, masm)
        See example Projects\Samples\MixedLanguage\MixLang_Demo.fbp for details

     - [Options]->[Environment]
        you can use nested expressions, they are resolved up to 5 levels,
        forwarding allowed
        e.g. greeting=%var1%, %var2%
             var1=hello
             var2=%target%
             target=world
        the variable %caret_word% can be used for starting up external help files
        see [Options]->[Help Menu]->MSDN-Library-2008 for an example howto startup
        microsofts dexplore.exe

     - [Edit]->[Find]
        Regex is available now
        A nice help button shortcuts into FbEdit.chm
        Also there is a small library tool to collect your heavily used
        regular expressions
        Now we can search all bi-files in fbc's include path looking for an
        definition or whatever
        Find setting are stored in FbEdit.ini now, so they are not lost
        All the nice buttons are context sensitive enabled/disabled

     - Project explorer
        A project can contain more than one .rc-file
        The primary .rc-file MUST be marked as main file (red icon)
        Only the primary .rc-file is compiled
        The primary .rc-file has to include its childs via:   #include "second.rc"
                                                              #include "third.rc"
                                                              ...
        At the same time only one .rc-file can be opened in graphics mode,
        all the others are switched to text mode automatically
        Doubleclicking a .rc-files in project explorer can be used to regain
        graphics mode

        now there is a "Scripts" section. Batch files inside can be started by
        doubleclick

     - Output window has a new selector
        please click the vertical label on the left side of the output window to
        show/hide the selector
        the column sizes are stored in fbedit.ini, so they are not lost

     - Statusbar section 2 (LOCK/UNLOCK), 3 (LIN/BLK) and 4 (INS/OVR) is clickable

     - Toolbar addin
        an error message is created, if the corresponding .bmp-file was not found

     - VKDebug
        a FbEdit version of VKDebug dumps directly to FbEdits output window
        now masm32/JWasm non-natives have some low level debugging support
        for details see Projects\Samples\MixedLanguage\

     - ResEd
        filespecs pointing to include or resource files are stored with
        relative pathes
        .rc-file relocation is easier to do now

     - (Untitled).bas / (Untitled).rc
        a full qualified path %TEMP%\(Untitled).bas[.rc] is assigned on creation
        so path aware autocompletes should work before saving

     - Autocomplete #inclib "...
        entities prefix (lib) is removed

     - [Options]->[Code Editor]
        output window's font is selectable
        output, immediate, register, fpu, mmx window are effected immediately
        showvars window needs an restart of FbEdit

     - Project explorer / file browser context menu
        there is a [Open Extern] button to launch the selected file/folder by your
        systems standard application

     - [Options]->[Code Editor]
        there is a [Show Splash] checkbox

     - ResEd
        MENUITEM exports MenuItemId explicitly (i.e. as 0 if empty)
        needed for windres (FreeBASIC MinGW edition)

     - windres (FreeBASIC MinGW edition) build errors are recognized

     - [Format]->[Custom Filter]
        Custom Filters are simple console programs written in Freebasic or something else,
        compiled to exes and located to ...\FbEdit\CustomFilter\
        where they can be found by FbEdit encountered into submenu [Custom Filter]
        The submenu is updated only on FbEdit's startup
        A Custom Filter reads his STDIN, modifies the read data and send it back by STDOUT
        An example can be found at ...\FbEdit\CustomFilter\
        FbEdit pipes only selected text to STDIN, so selection has to be done before using an
        sub menu entry

     - [Options]->[Code Editor]
        there is a two new editboxes for lists of extensions
        Open Extern: these files are opened with shellexecute by default
        Code Files : these files are loaded into code editors by default

     - [Edit]->[Find]
        there is a new editbox for a list of extensions
        Load For Project Search: these files are loaded during project wide searches
