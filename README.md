### Build

Theoretically, all you would have to do is change Make.ini and run Make.bat, but I had a lot of problems doing that myself and did various changes to make it work. It is possible, though, that it now doesn't work for some others.

If you just want to use a precompiled version, you can get it here: https://github.com/CherryDT/FbEditMOD/releases/ (You will need to customize some things in the FbEdit.ini file though. Please also read the top entries in Changelog.txt.)
